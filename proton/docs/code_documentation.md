## Flagpole

Proton uses a "flagpole" style of documentation, which includes exactly 40 horizontal dashes where needed. For example:

```
"""
+---------------------------------------- <- 40 horizontal dashes
| Section Title
+---------------------------------------- <- 40 horizontal dashes
| Code documentation goes in here...
|
| Also, at the end, always have an extra vertical
| line for spacing below, like the one 
| below this line.
| 

"""
